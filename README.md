# HTS - Hypothesis Testing Solver 🧠📊

**HTS (Hypothesis Testing Solver)** is a web-based platform that helps users perform and understand hypothesis testing using three different methods: the Traditional Method, P-value Method, and Confidence Interval Method. It is designed to guide users through each statistical approach clearly and interactively, complete with visualizations and step-by-step calculations.

---

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ Supports 3 key hypothesis testing methods:
  - **Traditional Method**
  - **P-value Method**
  - **Confidence Interval Method**

- 📘 For each method, we explain:
  - What the method is
  - Why and when to use it
  - The step-by-step calculation process

- 📊 Test the following **6 statistical parameters**:
  - Population Mean (μ)
  - Population Variance (σ²)
  - Population Proportion (p)
  - Difference between Means (μ₁ − μ₂)
  - Difference between Proportions (p₁ − p₂)
  - Difference between Variances (σ₁² − σ₂²)

- 🔢 **Statistical Calculations Page**:
  - Enter raw data (comma or space separated)
  - Calculate: Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation
  - Automatically sorts and counts your data

- 📈 Visualizations using `matplotlib` for hypothesis test results

- 🧮 Each result page clearly displays:
  - Test statistics
  - Critical values
  - Decision results
  - All steps used in the test

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)  
- **Visualization:** matplotlib
